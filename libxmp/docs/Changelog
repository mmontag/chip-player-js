Experimental versions
---------------------

0.99c (19970320): Fixed more bugs reported by Michael Janson

	  only when the slide nibble is not zero (fixes PM's 2nd Reality)
	- XM patterns with 0 (==0xff) rows are being correctly handled
	  (Wave's Home Vist should play better)
	- Tone portamento effect does not reset envelopes (fixes Wave's
	  Home Visit pattern 0, channels 0 to 5)

	  using gmod's method to prevent clicking
	- Continue vibrato effect bug fixed

	  guitar in Zodiak's Status Mooh order 7, channel 7)

	  Slinger) - delay was working as note retrig
