## You also can build library manually:
You need to make in the any IDE a library project and put into it next files
(or include those files into subfolder of your exist project instead if you want to use it statically):

### Useful macros
* `BWMIDI_DISABLE_XMI_SUPPORT` - Disables XMI to MIDI converter
* `BWMIDI_DISABLE_MUS_SUPPORT` - Disables MUS to MIDI converter
* `ADLMIDI_DISABLE_MIDI_SEQUENCER` - Completely disables built-in MIDI sequencer.
* `ADLMIDI_DISABLE_DOSBOX_EMULATOR` - Disables DosBox 0.74 OPL3 emulator.
* `ADLMIDI_DISABLE_NUKED_EMULATOR` - Disables Nuked OPL3 emulator.
* `DISABLE_EMBEDDED_BANKS` - Disables usage of embedded banks. Use it to use custom-only banks.

### Public header (include)
* adlmidi.h     - Library Public API header, use it to control library

### Internal code (src)
* chips/*       - Various OPL3 chip emulators and commonized interface over them
* wopl/*        - WOPL bank format library
* adldata.hh    - bank structures definition
* adldata_db.h  - Embedded banks database structures and containers definitions
* adlmidi_private.hpp - header of internal private APIs
* adlmidi_bankmap.h - MIDI bank hash table
* adlmidi_bankmap.tcc - MIDI bank hash table (Implementation)
* adlmidi_cvt.hpp - Instrument conversion template
* adlmidi_ptr.hpp - Custom implementations of smart pointers for C++98
* file_reader.hpp - Generic file and memory reader

* adldata.cpp	  - Automatically generated database of FM banks from "fm_banks" directory via "gen_adldata" tool. **Don't build it if you defined the `DISABLE_EMBEDDED_BANKS` macro!**
* adlmidi.cpp     - code of library
* adlmidi_load.cpp	- Source of file loading and parsing processing
* adlmidi_midiplay.cpp	- MIDI event sequencer
* adlmidi_opl3.cpp	- OPL3 chips manager
* adlmidi_private.cpp	- some internal functions sources

#### MIDI Sequencer
To remove MIDI Sequencer, define `ADLMIDI_DISABLE_MIDI_SEQUENCER` macro and remove all those files
* adlmidi_sequencer.cpp	- MIDI Sequencer related source
* cvt_mus2mid.hpp - MUS2MID converter source (define `BWMIDI_DISABLE_MUS_SUPPORT` macro to remove MUS support)
* cvt_xmi2mid.hpp - XMI2MID converter source (define `BWMIDI_DISABLE_XMI_SUPPORT` macro to remove XMI support)
* fraction.hpp  - Fraction number handling (Used by Sequencer only)
* midi_sequencer.h	- MIDI Sequencer C bindings
* midi_sequencer.hpp	- MIDI Sequencer C++ declaration
* midi_sequencer_impl.hpp	- MIDI Sequencer C++ implementation (must be once included into one of CPP together with interfaces initializations)



**Important**: Please use DosBox emulator on mobile devices because it requires small CPU power. Nuked OPL synthesizer is very accurate (compared to real OPL3 chip), but it requires much more power device and is high probability your device will lag and playback will be choppy.

**Tip 1**: If you want to work with custom WOPL banks without using of embedded banks, you can create them by using [OPL3 Bank Editor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor) where also included some WOPL examples, or you are able to save any other bank as WOPL.

**Tip 2**: To compile libADLMIDI without embedded banks, define the `DISABLE_EMBEDDED_BANKS` macro and remove building of the `adldata.cpp` file in your project.

# Example
In the utils/midiplay you will found an example project which uses this library.
That example is a simple audio player based on SDL Audio usage.

To build that example you will need to have installed SDL2 library.

# Working demos

* [PGE MusPlay for Win32](http://wohlsoft.ru/docs/_laboratory/_Builds/win32/bin-w32/_packed/pge-musplay-master-win32.zip) and [Win64](http://wohlsoft.ru/docs/_laboratory/_Builds/win32/bin-w64/_packed/pge-musplay-master-win64.zip) (also available for other platforms as part of [PGE Project](https://github.com/WohlSoft/PGE-Project)) - a little music player which uses SDL Mixer X library (fork of the SDL Mixer 2.0) which has embedded libADLMIDI to play MIDI files independently from operating system's settings and drivers. <br>(source code of player can be find [here](https://github.com/WohlSoft/PGE-Project/tree/master/MusicPlayer) and source code of SDL Mixer X [here](https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X/))
* [ADLMIDI Player for Android](https://github.com/Wohlstand/ADLMIDI-Player-Java/releases) - a little MIDI-player for Android which uses libADLMIDI to play MIDI files and provides flexible GUI with ability to change bank, flags, number of emulated chips, etc.
* [ADLMIDI Player for DOS32](http://wohlsoft.ru/docs/_laboratory/_Builds/dos/adlmidi-dos32.zip) - a little MIDI-player built with DJGPP toolchain for DOS operating system for old computers to play music on the real OPL3 hardware. Archive contains two variants: `adlmidi.exe` is the main variant; `adlmidi2.exe` is the reincarnation of original ADLMIDI player by Joel Yliluoma made over modern libADLMIDI backend.

 * Added support for real-time switching the emulator
 * Added support for CC-120 - "All sound off" on the MIDI channel
 * Changed logic of CC-74 Brightness to affect sound only between 0 and 64 like real XG synthesizers. Ability to turn on a full-ranged brightness (to use full 0...127 range) is kept.

 * Added an ability to reset song position to begin (very helpful when song reaches the end)
 * Avoided possible crashes on attempt to fetch sample data without opening of MIDI file
 * Demo tool now can correctly record WAVs and now can correctly deal with CTRL+C termination
 * When loop is disabled, loop points will be ignored
 * Loop now is disabled by default
 * Reworked internal storage of MIDI events to easier pre-process them and retrieve any useful information before play them

 * Added new functions: adl_linkedLibraryVersion(), adl_errorInfo(), adl_tickEvents(), and adl_generate()
 * Error string is no more global, now every ADL_MIDIPlayer instance has own thread-safe error info that can be retreived by using adl_errorInfo() function. The adl_errorString() will return library initialization errors only;
 * Added С++ Extra public API which now includes instrument testing feature (which is required by classic ADLMIDI utility)
 * Multi-bank WOPL files now supported! Feel free to implement GS or XG - compatible bank
 * Added support for DJGPP compiler to build libADLMIDI for DOS to use hardware OPL3 chip
 * Added XG percussion bank channel handling support, XG MIDI files are using custom percussion channels are now playing fine!
 * Fixed damaged playback while loop music caused by state of controllers came from end of current melody
 * Added Brightness (CC74) controller which will affect modulator scale

## 1.0.2	2016-03-16
 * Fixed infinite loop causes swapped loopEnd and loopStart (when loopEnd goes before loopStart)
 * Fixed sielent volume tracks (when initial voule is zero, tracks wouldn't be playd even after applying fading in volume events)
 * More accurate fine tuning for second voice for DMX-based banks (playback now is more like original DOOM than before!)
 * Library's Output data now in short format (no more need to do extra conversions to make 16-bit audio stream from every 16-bit
   sample stored into each 32-bit integer)
