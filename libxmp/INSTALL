Requirements
------------

- This package needs to be built using GNU make
  (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). On BSD or SysV systems, you may
  need to use "gmake" instead of "make".


Building the library
--------------------

In most systems just execute:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

We'll build the shared library by default. Use ./configure --enable-static
to build the static library. To check if the library was correctly built,
run:

  $ make check

Use ./configure --help to see more options.

For emscripten, remember to pass the correct host os to configure, e.g.:

  $ emconfigure ./configure --host=wasm32-unknown-emscripten


You can also use the CMake build system to build libxmp, which requires
cmake versions 3.2 or newer ( https://cmake.org )


To build for Windows using Visual Studio, use Makefile.vc:

  nmake -f Makefile.vc   (read/edit Makefile.vc as necessary.)


To build for Windows using OpenWatcom, use Makefile.w32:

  wmake -f Makefile.w32  (read/edit Makefile.w32 as necessary.)


To build for OS/2 using OpenWatcom, use Makefile.os2:

  wmake -f Makefile.os2  (read/edit Makefile.os2 as necessary.)


Installation
------------

To install the library and development components, just run:

# make install

as the superuser. This will install the shared and static libraries,
header file and pkg-config file into directories under /usr/local or a
different location selected with the --prefix option in configure.
