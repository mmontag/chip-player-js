     Have you ever wondered how the files are built up? Well. here is the
     file formats I use:

      Offset    Length (Bytes)         Description

        0            4                 'SAdT' These for bytes mark a Song.
        4            1                 Version number (currently 9)
        5           465                The 31 Instruments
       470          496                The 31 Instrument names
       966          128                Patternorder
      1094           2                 Number of Patterns (NoP)
      1096           1                 Length of Song
      1097           1                 Restart Position
      1098           2                 BPM
      1100          256                Arpeggiolist

      2190        ???*192              Trackdata

   Trackorder is an 64*9 array that points to the tracks.
   Track 0 is a empty track (not saved).

   each track is saved as follows:

   64 lines of:
      nnnnnnni iiiieeee ppppPPPP  = 3 Bytes
      (where n indicates a bit for the note,
             i indicates a bit for the instruments,
             e indicates a bit for the effect and
             p/P indicates the effect-parameter bits.)
      therefore 64*3 = 192 Bytes.


     The Instrument Format:                                           Page 17

       Offset    Length (Bytes)         Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         0          11                  Instrumentdata
        11           4                  Arpeggiodata

     O.K. here's how the instrument data is built up:

        Byte 1:
           Bit    0: Frequenzy modulation / additiv synthesis
           Bits 1-3: Feedback
        Byte 2:
           Bits 0-3: Freq. Multiplier     -.
           Bit    4: Scaling               |
           Bit    5: Sustaining Sound      + Connector
           Bit    6: Vibrato               |
           Bit    7: Amp. Vibrato         -'
        Byte 3:
           just like Byte 2, just for the Carrier
        Byte 4:
           Bits 0-3: Decay Rate
           Bits 4-7: Attack Rate        Connector
        Byte 5
           Decy, Attack Carrier
        Byte 6
           Bits 0-3: Release Rate
           Bits 4-7: Sustain Level       Connector
        Byte 7
           Release, Sustain level Carrier
        Byte 8
           Waveform Connector
        Byte 9
           Waveform Carrier
        Byte 10
          Bits 0-5: Volume
          Bits 6-7: Level Scaling Connector
        Byte 11
          Volume, Level Scaling Carrier

     The Arpeggiodata consists of:

       ArpeggioStart, ArpeggioSpeed, CurrentPos, SpeedCount, each value is a
       byte long.
