## Development Notes

### Architecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The player engines come from C/C++ libraries such as [game-music-emu](https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/wiki/Home) and [libxmp](https://github.com/cmatsuoka/libxmp), compiled to JS with [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site). Where possible, these projects are incorporated using `git subtree`.

The C/C++ code is compiled by [scripts/build-chip-core.js](scripts/build-chip-core.js). This file also defines the list of exports that will be available to the JavaScript program. Components that go into this build are as follows:

* Manually selected cpp sources from game-music-emu.
* For libraries with their own build system like LibXMP and Fluidlite (detailed [below](#Building)):
    * Build a static library with Emscripten (i.e. using emconfigure, emmake)
    * Link the static library in build-chip-core.js
* **tinyplayer.c**: a super light MIDI file reader/player
* **showcqtbar.c**: a modified [FFMPEG plugin](https://github.com/mfcc64/html5-showcqtbar) providing lovely [constant Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-Q_transform#Comparison_with_the_Fourier_transform) spectrum analysis for the visualizer.

The music catalog is created by [scripts/build-catalog.js](scripts/build-catalog.js). **This script looks for a ./catalog folder to build a music index.** This location is untracked, so put a symlink here that points to your local music archive. TODO: Document the corresponding public location (`CATALOG_PREFIX`).

### Local Development Setup

Prerequisites: yarn, cmake, emsdk.

* Clone the repository. 
* Run `yarn install`.

In building the subprojects, we ultimately invoke `emmake make` instead of `make` to yield an object file that Emscripten can link to in the final build.

* Install the [Emscripten SDK (emsdk)](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk).
* The build script in [package.json](package.json) looks for the emsdk in `~/src/emsdk`. Modify this line to match your emsdk install location if necessary:

  ```"build-chip-core": "source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh; node scripts/build-chip-core.js",```
  
#### Tight coupling to Github Pages

The project is currently set up to deploy to Github Pages. The `deploy` and `deploy-lite` NPM scripts invoke the gh-pages NPM module. 

If you wish to deploy to your own Github Pages account, change the `"homepage"` field in package.json.

#### User Accounts and Saved Favorites Functionality

User account management is provided through Firebase Cloud Firestore. You must obtain your own [Google Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) credentials and update [src/config/firebaseConfig.js](src/config/firebaseConfig.js) with these credentials. This file is not tracked. Without these credentials, Login/Favorites functionality won't work.

#### Subproject: libxmp-lite

Our goal is to produce **libxmp/libxmp-lite-stagedir/lib/libxmp-lite.a**.
Build libxmp (uses GNU make):

```sh
cd chip-player-js/libxmp/        # navigate to libxmp root
source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # load the emscripten environment variables
autoconf
emconfigure ./configure
emmake make
```

Proceed to build libxmp-lite:

```sh
emmake make -f Makefile.lite     # this will have some errors, but they can be ignored
cd libxmp-lite-stagedir/
autoconf
emconfigure ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
emmake make
```

#### Subproject: fluidlite

Our goal is to produce **fluidlite/build/libfluidlite.a**.
Build fluidlite (uses Cmake):

```sh
cd chip-player-js/fluidlite/     # navigate to fluidlite root
source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # load the emscripten environment variables
mkdir build                      # create a build folder for Cmake output
cd build                         
emcmake cmake -DDISABLE_SF3=1 .. # Cmake will generate a Makefile by default
                                 # Problems here? Try deleting CMake cache files
emmake make fluidlite-static
```

#### Subproject: psflib and lazyusf2

Our goal is to produce **psflib/libpsflib.a** and **lazyusf2/liblazyusf.a**. These use a special Emscripten.Makefile (loosely based on [Jeurgen Wothke's webn64 .bat script](https://github.com/wothke/webn64/blob/master/emscripten/makeEmscripten.bat)).

Build psflib:

```sh
cd chip-player-js/psflib/
source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # load the emscripten environment variables
emmake make -f Emscripten.Makefile libpsflib.a
```

Build liblazyusf:

```sh
cd ../lazyusf2/
emmake make -f Emscripten.Makefile liblazyusf.a
```

#### Subproject: libvgm

Our goal is to produce **libvgm/build/bin/libvgm-emu.a**, **libvgm/build/bin/libvgm-player.a**, and **libvgm/build/bin/libvgm-util.a**.

```sh
cd chip-player-js/libvgm/
source ~/src/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh  # load the emscripten environment variables
mkdir build                      # create a build folder for Cmake output
cd build
emcmake cmake ..
emmake make
```

To reconfigure the build-enabled sound chips with CMake UI, run `emcmake ccmake ..` from the build folder. Make desired changes to build flags, then `c` to configure and `g` to generate new Makefile. Then run `emmake make`. Optionally, commit the same changes back to CMakeLists.txt in libvgm parent folder. 

#### WebAssembly build

Once these are in place we can build the parent project.
Our goal is to produce **public/chip-core.wasm**.

```sh
cd chip-player-js/
yarn run build-chip-core
```

This will use object files created in the previous steps and link them into chip-core.wasm.
If you change some C/C++ component of the subprojects, you'll need to redo this process.
Once we have chip-core.wasm, we can proceed to develop JavaScript interactively on localhost:

```sh
yarn start
```

Build the entire project:

```sh
yarn build
```

Or deploy to Github Pages:

```sh
yarn deploy
```

Deploy to Github Pages without rebuilding chip-core.wasm: 

```sh
yarn deploy-lite
```
