Introduction
------------

Libxmp is a module player library supporting many mainstream and obscure
module formats including Protracker MOD, Scream Tracker III S3M and
Impulse Tracker IT. Libxmp loads the module and renders the sound as
linear PCM samples in a buffer at rate and format specified by the user,
one frame at a time (standard modules usually play at 50 frames per second).

Possible applications for libxmp include stand-alone module players, module
player plugins for other players, module information extractors, background
music replayers for games and other applications, module-to-mp3 renderers, etc.


Concepts
~~~~~~~~

* **Player context:**
  Most libxmp functions require a handle that identifies the module player
  context. Each context is independent and multiple contexts can be defined
  simultaneously.

* **Sequence:**
  Each group of positions in the order list that loops over itself, also
  known as "subsong". Most modules have only one sequence, but some modules,
  especially modules used in games can have multiple sequences. "Hidden
  patterns" outside the main song are also listed as extra sequences, certain
  module authors such as Skaven commonly place extra patterns at the end of
  the module.

* **State:** *[Added in libxmp 4.2]*
  The player can be in one of three possible states: *unloaded*, *loaded*,
  or *playing*. The player is in unloaded state after context creation,
  changing to other states when a module is loaded or played.

* **External sample mixer:** *[Added in libxmp 4.2]*
  Special sound channels can be reserved using `xmp_start_smix()`
  to play module instruments or external samples. This is useful when
  libxmp is used to provide background music to games or other applications
  where sound effects can be played in response to events or user actions

* **Amiga mixer:** *[Added in libxmp 4.4]*
  Certain formats may use special mixers modeled after the original hardware
  used to play the format, providing more realistic sound at the expense of
  CPU usage. Currently Amiga formats such as Protracker can use a mixer
  modeled after the Amiga 500, with or without the led filter.

A simple example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example loads a module, plays it at 44.1kHz and writes it to a raw
sound file::

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <xmp.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        xmp_context c;
        struct xmp_frame_info mi;
        FILE *f;

        /* The output raw file */
        f = fopen("out.raw", "wb");
        if (f == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "can't open output file\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        /* Create the player context */
        c = xmp_create_context();

        /* Load our module */
        if (xmp_load_module(c, argv[1]) != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "can't load module\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        /* Play the module */
        xmp_start_player(c, 44100, 0);
        while (xmp_play_frame(c) == 0) {
            xmp_get_frame_info(c, &mi);

            if (mi.loop_count > 0)    /* exit before looping */
                break;

            fwrite(mi.buffer, mi.buffer_size, 1, f);  /* write audio data */
        }
        xmp_end_player(c);
        xmp_release_module(c);        /* unload module */
        xmp_free_context(c);          /* destroy the player context */

        fclose(f);

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }


A player context can load and play a single module at a time. Multiple
contexts can be defined if needed.

Use `xmp_test_module()`_ to check if the file is a valid module and
retrieve the module name and type. Use `xmp_load_module()`_ to load
the module to memory. These two calls return 0 on success or <0 in case of
error. Error codes are::

  -XMP_ERROR_INTERNAL   /* Internal error */
  -XMP_ERROR_FORMAT     /* Unsupported module format */
  -XMP_ERROR_LOAD       /* Error loading file */
  -XMP_ERROR_DEPACK     /* Error depacking file */
  -XMP_ERROR_SYSTEM     /* System error */
  -XMP_ERROR_STATE      /* Incorrect player state */

If a system error occurs, the specific error is set in ``errno``.

Parameters to `xmp_start_player()`_ are the sampling
rate (up to 48kHz) and a bitmapped integer holding one or more of the
following mixer flags::

  XMP_MIX_8BIT          /* Mix to 8-bit instead of 16 */
  XMP_MIX_UNSIGNED      /* Mix to unsigned samples */
  XMP_MIX_MONO          /* Mix to mono instead of stereo */
  XMP_MIX_NEAREST       /* Mix using nearest neighbor interpolation */
  XMP_MIX_NOFILTER      /* Disable lowpass filter */

After `xmp_start_player()`_ is called, each call to `xmp_play_frame()`_
will render an audio frame. Call `xmp_get_frame_info()`_ to retrieve the
buffer address and size. `xmp_play_frame()`_ returns 0 on success or -1
if replay should stop.

Use `xmp_end_player()`_, `xmp_release_module()`_ and
`xmp_free_context()`_ to release memory and end replay.


SDL example
~~~~~~~~~~~

To use libxmp with SDL, just provide a callback function that renders module
data. The module will play when ``SDL_PauseAudio(0)`` is called::

    #include <SDL/SDL.h>
    #include <xmp.h>

    static void fill_audio(void *udata, unsigned char *stream, int len)
    {
        xmp_play_buffer(udata, stream, len, 0);
    }

    int sound_init(xmp_context ctx, int sampling_rate, int channels)
    {
        SDL_AudioSpec a;

        a.freq = sampling_rate;
        a.format = (AUDIO_S16);
        a.channels = channels;
        a.samples = 2048;
        a.callback = fill_audio;
        a.userdata = ctx;

        if (SDL_OpenAudio(&a, NULL) < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", SDL_GetError());
                return -1;
        }
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        xmp_context ctx;

        if ((ctx = xmp_create_context()) == NULL)
                return 1;

        sound_init(ctx, 44100, 2);
        xmp_load_module(ctx, argv[1]);
        xmp_start_player(ctx, 44100, 0);

        SDL_PauseAudio(0);

        sleep(10); /* Do something important here */

        SDL_PauseAudio(1);

        xmp_end_player(ctx);
        xmp_release_module(ctx);
        xmp_free_context(ctx);

        SDL_CloseAudio();
        return 0;
    }

SDL callbacks run in a separate thread, so don't forget to protect sections
that manipulate module data with ``SDL_LockAudio()`` and ``SDL_UnlockAudio()``.

        XMP_FORMAT_UNSIGNED     /* Mix to unsigned samples */
        XMP_FORMAT_MONO         /* Mix to mono instead of stereo */

  **Returns:**
    0 if successful, or a negative error code in case of error.
    Error codes can be ``-XMP_ERROR_INTERNAL`` in case of a internal player
    error, ``-XMP_ERROR_INVALID`` if the sampling rate is invalid, or
    ``-XMP_ERROR_SYSTEM`` in case of system error (the system error
    code is set in ``errno``).

.. _xmp_play_frame():

int xmp_play_frame(xmp_context c)
`````````````````````````````````

  Play one frame of the module. Modules usually play at 50 frames per second.
  Use `xmp_get_frame_info()`_ to retrieve the buffer containing audio data.

  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.

  **Returns:**
    0 if successful, ``-XMP_END`` if the module ended or was stopped, or
    ``-XMP_ERROR_STATE`` if the player is not in playing state.

.. _xmp_play_buffer():

int xmp_play_buffer(xmp_context c, void \*buffer, int size, int loop)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

  *[Added in libxmp 4.1]* Fill the buffer with PCM data up to the specified
  size. This is a convenience function that calls `xmp_play_frame()`_
  internally to fill the user-supplied buffer. **Don't call both
  xmp_play_frame() and xmp_play_buffer() in the same replay loop.**
  If you don't need equally sized data chunks, `xmp_play_frame()`_
  may result in better performance. Also note that silence is added
  at the end of a buffer if the module ends and no loop is to be performed.

  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.

    :buffer: the buffer to fill with PCM data, or NULL to reset the
     internal state.

    :size: the buffer size in bytes.

    :loop: stop replay when the loop counter reaches the specified
     value, or 0 to disable loop checking.

  **Returns:**
    0 if successful, ``-XMP_END`` if module was stopped or the loop counter
    was reached, or ``-XMP_ERROR_STATE`` if the player is not in playing
    state.

.. _xmp_get_frame_info():

void xmp_get_frame_info(xmp_context c, struct xmp_frame_info \*info)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

  Retrieve the current frame data.

  **Parameters:**
    :c: the player context handle.

    :info: pointer to structure containing current frame data.
      ``struct xmp_frame_info`` is defined as follows::

        struct xmp_frame_info {           /* Current frame information */
            int pos;            /* Current position */
            int pattern;        /* Current pattern */

            int loop_count;     /* Loop counter */
            int virt_channels;  /* Number of virtual channels */
            int virt_used;      /* Used virtual channels */
            int sequence;       /* Current sequence */

            struct xmp_channel_info {     /* Current channel information */
                unsigned int period;      /* Sample period */
                unsigned int position;    /* Sample position */
                short pitchbend;          /* Linear bend from base note*/
                unsigned char note;       /* Current base note number */
                unsigned char instrument; /* Current instrument number */
                unsigned char sample;     /* Current sample number */

                struct xmp_event event;   /* Current track event */
            } channel_info[XMP_MAX_CHANNELS];
        };

      This function should be used to retrieve sound buffer data after
      `xmp_play_frame()`_ is called. Fields ``buffer`` and ``buffer_size``
      contain the pointer to the sound buffer PCM data and its size. The
      buffer size will be no larger than ``XMP_MAX_FRAMESIZE``.

    * *[Added in libxmp 4.4]* Player personality: The player can be forced to
      emulate a specific tracker in cases where the module relies on a format
      quirk and tracker detection fails. Valid modes are::

          XMP_MODE_AUTO         /* Autodetect mode (default) */
          XMP_MODE_MOD          /* Play as a generic MOD player */

          XMP_MODE_ITSMP        /* Play using IT sample mode quirks */

      By default, formats similar to S3M such as PTM or IMF will use S3M
      replayer (without Scream Tracker 3 quirks/bug emulation), and formats
      similar to XM such as RTM and MDL will use the XM replayer (without             FT2 quirks/bug emulation).

      Multichannel MOD files will use the XM replayer, and Scream Tracker 3
      MOD files will use S3M replayer with ST3 quirks. S3M files will use
      the most appropriate replayer according to the tracker used to create
      the file, and enable Scream Tracker 3 quirks and bugs only if created
      using ST3. XM files will be played with FT2 bugs and quirks only if
      created using Fast Tracker II.

      Modules created with OpenMPT will be played with all bugs and quirks
      of the original trackers.

    * *[Added in libxmp 4.4]* Maximum number of mixer voices: the maximum
      number of virtual channels that can be used to play the module. If
      set too high, modules with voice leaks can cause excessive CPU usage.
      Default is 128.

  **Returns:**
    0 if parameter was correctly set, ``-XMP_ERROR_INVALID`` if
    parameter or values are out of the valid ranges, or ``-XMP_ERROR_STATE``
    if the player is not in playing state.

External sample mixer API
-------------------------

Libxmp 4.2 includes a mini-API that can be used to add sound effects to
games and similar applications, provided that you have a low latency sound
system. It allows module instruments or external sample files in WAV format
to be played in response to arbitrary events.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example using SDL loads a module and a sound sample, plays the module
as background music, and plays the sample when a key is pressed::

    #include <SDL/SDL.h>
    #include <xmp.h>

    static void fill_audio(void *udata, unsigned char *stream, int len)
    {
        xmp_play_buffer(udata, stream, len, 0);
    }

    int sound_init(xmp_context ctx, int sampling_rate, int channels)

        a.format = (AUDIO_S16);
        a.channels = channels;
        a.samples = 2048;
        a.callback = fill_audio;
        a.userdata = ctx;

        if (SDL_OpenAudio(&a, NULL) < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", SDL_GetError());
                return -1;

            fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", SDL_GetError());
            return -1;
        }
        if (SDL_SetVideoMode(640, 480, 8, 0) == NULL) {

        while (1) {
            if (SDL_WaitEvent(&event)) {
                if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
                    if (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_ESCAPE)
                        break;
                    xmp_smix_play_sample(ctx, 0, 60, 64, 0);
                }
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
