	Size and speed optimizations by Manuel Novoa III  (mjn3@codepoet.org).

	More efficient reading of huffman codes, a streamlined read_bunzip()
	function, and various other tweaks.  In (limited) tests, approximately
	20% faster than bzcat on x86 and about 10% faster on arm.

	Note that about 2/3 of the time is spent in read_unzip() reversing
	the Burrows-Wheeler transformation.  Much of that time is delay
	resulting from cache misses.

	I would ask that anyone benefiting from this work, especially those
	using it in commercial products, consider making a donation to my local
	non-profit hospice organization (see www.hospiceacadiana.com) in the
